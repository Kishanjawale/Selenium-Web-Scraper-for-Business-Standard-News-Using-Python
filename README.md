# Selenium-Web-Scraper-for-Business-Standard-News-Using-Python

## Description:
This Python script utilizes the Selenium library to perform web scraping on the Business Standard website (https://www.business-standard.com/) to extract the latest news. The extracted news is then displayed, with special formatting applied to highlight news containing specific keywords, such as 'Q2', 'Q3', 'result', 'up', and 'rises'. The script aims to provide a quick overview of important news by applying color-coding to the console output.

## Key Features:
Network Connectivity Check:

The script begins by checking for network connectivity using a simple socket connection test to the Google DNS server (8.8.8.8). This ensures that the script can fetch data only when an active network connection is available.
Headless Chrome WebDriver:

The script uses the Chrome WebDriver for Selenium automation. While headless mode is commented out, it can be easily enabled by uncommenting the corresponding line in the code. Headless mode allows the script to run without opening a visible browser window.
XPath-based Element Extraction:

Selenium's WebDriverWait is employed to wait for elements to be present on the page, enhancing reliability. XPath expressions are used to locate and extract relevant news elements from the Business Standard website.
Colorama for Console Formatting:

The Colorama library is utilized to add color to the console output. Important news containing specific keywords is displayed in red and bright text, providing a visual cue to the user.


## Usage:
Ensure the ChromeDriver executable path is correctly set (chrome_driver_path variable).
Modify the website_url_business_standards variable if you wish to scrape a different website.
Run the script to obtain the latest news with highlighted important updates.

##Dependencies:
Selenium: Web automation library.
Colorama: Console text formatting library.

## Note:
This script is intended for educational and informational purposes. Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service when using web scraping tools.
